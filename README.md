# Background
This project came from my own curiosity and the need to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively. I wanted to find out which skills lead to the highest-paying jobs and which ones are in the highest demand.

Through my SQL queries, I set out to answer some key questions about the data analyst job market:

1) Which data analyst jobs offer the highest salaries?

2) What skills do these high-paying roles require?

3) Which skills are currently in the highest demand for data analysts?

4) Are there specific skills that consistently lead to higher salaries?

5) What are the best skills to learn to land a well-paying data analyst job?
# Tools I Used
 - **SQL**: helping me query the database and extract key trends.
 - **PostgreSQL**: My database of choice, perfect for managing and analyzing job posting data.
 - **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to workspace for writing and running SQL queries efficiently.
 - **Git & GitHub**: Keeping everything organized with version control, sharing my work, and making collaboration seamless.
# The Analysis
Every query in this project was designed to uncover key insights about the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I tackled each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To find the highest-paying roles, I filtered job postings based on average yearly salary and location, with a focus on remote opportunities. This helped highlight where the best-paying data analyst jobs are and what factors might contribute to their high salaries.
```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS Company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Breakdown of the Top Data Analyst Jobs:

 - Wide Salary Range: The top paying data analyst roles offer salaries between $184,000 and $650,000, highlighting the vast earning potential in this field.
 - Diverse Employers: High salaries aren‚Äôt limited to one industry. Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are leading the way, proving that demand for data analysts spans multiple sectors.
 - Varied Job Titles: From Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, the job market reflects a broad spectrum of roles, showing how specialization and experience can shape career growth in data analytics.
